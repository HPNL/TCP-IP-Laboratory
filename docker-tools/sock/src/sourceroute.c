 * the 3-byte source route type/len/offset) because with the BSD
 * IP_OPTIONS socket option we can specify up to 9 addresses, followed
 * by the destination address.  The in_pcbopts() function in the kernel
 * then takes the final address in the list (the destination) and moves
 * it to the front, as shown in Figure 9.33 of "TCP/IP Illustrated,
 * Volume 2".  Also note that this destination address that we pass as
 * the final IP address in our array overrides the destination address
 * of the sendto() (Figure 9.28 of Volume 2).
