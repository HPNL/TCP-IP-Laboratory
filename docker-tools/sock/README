This is a standalone version of Richard Stevens' "sock" program, based
on the code available for the UNIX Network Programming book, at:

  http://www.kohala.com/start/unpv12e.html

I found this version at

  http://ttcplinux.sourceforge.net/tools/tools.html

and cleaned up the tarball a bit. To make sock a little easier to
find, I'm now hosting it on a dedicated webpage:

  http://www.icir.org/christian/sock.html

I will implement minor updates to the code when I feel they make sense
for reasons of clarity or educational value, but I won't make any other
changes (such as additional features or similars).

I'm happy to incorporate build fixes where feasible and necessary, but
I do not give build support etc.

						Enjoy,
						Christian
